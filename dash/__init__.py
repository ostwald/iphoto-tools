dashboard type functionality

- dashboard.py - first stabs at comparison (via libcmp, which itself may need work)

- rolls_and_photos.py - test out IPhotoLibrary range accessors
	- getRolls, and getPhotos (start, end)

	- note these iPhotoLibrary calls should pass an args dict so
	  that we can pass filters and/or queries
